# Build your own website (ft. Orpheus)

![Backdrop](assets/backdrop.jpeg)

Hold on to your seats, we're going to build a webs- wait a moment, I'm intercepting a transmission...

`> Hey there, comrades! It’s Orpheus, your coding dino buddy. I might be a bunch of pixels, but I’ve got big dreams and an even bigger appetite for learning. My art may not be the prettiest - but hey, being a dino in a world of humans, I do my best!`

`> We're here for an exciting workshop where we'll build your very own website. By harnessing the power of HTML and CSS, you will create a website that you can then deploy to the internet.`

`> So put your shades on, and through the deep oceans and over the moon, we’ll support each other as we explore and learn. Fasten your seat belts! - Orpheus`

## What is this workshop about?

Orpheus, the coding dino that you just met, is here to guide you through making your own personal website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
