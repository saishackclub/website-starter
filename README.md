# Build your own website (ft. Orpheus)

Hold on to your seats, we're going to build a webs- wait a moment, I'm intercepting a transmission...

`> Hey there, comrades! It’s Orpheus, your coding dino buddy. I might be a bunch of pixels, but I’ve got big dreams and an even bigger appetite for learning. My art may not be the prettiest - but hey, being a dino in a world of humans, I do my best!`

`> We're here for an exciting workshop where we'll build your very own website. By harnessing the power of HTML and CSS, you will create a website that you can then deploy to the internet.`

`> So put your shades on, and through the deep oceans and over the moon, we’ll support each other as we explore and learn. Fasten your seat belts! - Orpheus`
