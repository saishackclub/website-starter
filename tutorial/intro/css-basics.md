# CSS Basics

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets.** It's used to style the elements that you’ve created with HTML.

## Understanding CSS

Think of CSS as the skin and clothing of your HTML skeleton. It’s what makes your site look good.

- **Selectors**: Selectors are used to select the HTML element that you want to style.
- **Properties**: Once you’ve selected an element, you can define various properties for it, like color or font-size.
- **Values**: Properties are followed by a colon and then a value.

## Implementing CSS

There are three ways to implement CSS in your HTML file:

1. **Inline**: By using the `style` attribute in HTML elements.
2. **Internal**: By placing CSS in a `<style>` block in the HTML `<head>`.
3. **External**: By linking to an external CSS file.

## Example

Here's an example of CSS in action:

```css
/* This is a comment in CSS */
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

This CSS selects all `<p>` elements and makes the text color red and the font size 20 pixels.
