# Getting Started

Welcome to the exciting world of web development! In this section, we’ll lay the groundwork for building your very own personal website.

## Why Build a Personal Website?

Having a personal website is like having your own piece of the internet. Here’s why you should consider building one:

- **Online Portfolio**: A place to showcase your work, whether that be blog posts, photographs, or any other projects.
- **Resume**: An easily accessible and visually appealing version of your resume that can be viewed by potential employers.
- **Learn and Grow**: The process of building and maintaining a website is a great learning experience.

## What You’ll Need

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- A computer with internet access
- A text editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/))
- A web browser
