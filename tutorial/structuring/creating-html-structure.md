# Creating HTML Structure

In this part, we will focus on creating the structure of your website using HTML.

## HTML Document Structure

An HTML document has a specific structure which includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element. Inside it, we have the `<head>` and `<body>` elements.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Meta information goes here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's break this down.

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used to tell the browser that this is a HTML document.
- The `<html>` element is the root element that contains the whole HTML document.
- The `<head>` element contains meta information about the document, such as the title and keywords.
- The `<body>` element contains the visible content of the web page, like the headings and paragraphs that you want to display.

## Basic Page Elements

- `<header>`: Represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
- `<nav>`: Represents a section of a page that contains navigation links.
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a document or a section.

Let's move on to integrating CSS with HTML to style our structure.
